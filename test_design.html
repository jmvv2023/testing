								<h2><strong>Test Analysis</strong></h2>
								<p>Test analysis is the activity which defines <strong>WHAT</strong> need to be tested. This activity starts with the static test and finish when the test cases are approved. 
								It is the key activity to obtain the more efficient and effective test cycle.</p>
								<p>The test analysis shall allow identify in the early states of the solution errors or failures in the specifications and identify the testing types and techniques 
								appropriate to verify the solution under test.</p>
								<p>In order to assure the test cases design activity meets with the expectative, it is required to define standardization in the test case design activity, from a specific 
								test basis with the goal to obtain the maximum possible test coverage with the minimum number of test cases. 
								To bear in main:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>It is not possible to test everything; it is required to find a balance that allows covering all the specifications with the minor cost as possible</li>
									<li>Identify the risk functionalities as its mitigation. Use the Risk analysis to perform it.</li>
									<li>In dependence of the test strategy, it is required to determinate which test design techniques are the most appropriated to obtain the desired coverage</li>
									<li>The application of these techniques in whole test cases is that provides the success in the test case specification design activity</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h3>Analysis tasks</h3>
								<p>The requirements review and is to be done for elucidation to identify actual and expected results of testing.<br>
								Identification of requirements and gaps, non functional requirements such as usability, scalability, testability, maintainability, performance and security should be take aconunt.<br>
								All requirements that cannot be tested due to system and test environment constraints should be communicated to the solution responsable team. <br>
								During this phase, the testing team reviews and analyses the requirements and identifies the tests, which are to be performed and sets priorities for testing, the test environment 
								requirement includes the hardware and software requirements under which the required software is to be tested. </p>
								
															
							
								<h2><strong>Test Cases</strong></h2>
								<p>A test case is defined as a set of inputs, a set of execution conditions and an expected result, created with a specific goal. The test case is a part of a methodical and critical process by 
								which an application or any of its components are executed with the basic goal of defects detection. This execution has to be performed in planned and repeatable circumstances.</br>
								The concepts involved in the test case design are the following:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Every test situation occurs in at least 1 one test case</li>
									<li>A logical test case covers 1 or more test situation</li>
									<li>Every logical test case is worked out concretely into 1 physical test case</li>
									<li>Every physical test case occurs in 1 test script</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Test situation:</strong> A test situation is an isolated condition under which the test object displays a specific behaviour that needs to be tested.</br>
								<strong>Test Cases:</strong> A test case is used to examine whether the system displays the desired behaviour under specific circumstances. The goal of a test case 
								is to demonstrate objectively that the specification or requirement subject of test is implemented successfully. That means there are not differences between specifications and the implemented.</br> 
								<strong>Test Script:</strong> In a test script, multiple physical test cases are combined to be able to execute them in an efficient and simple manner. 
								General rules:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Minimum entity inside a test.</li>
									<li>It is not possible to be divided and it must be executed in the order stablished.</li>
									<li>Clearly present the test target and identify the casuistry that them provides coverage.</li>
									<li>It is not allowed to use own codes neither acronyms not defined in the project glossary.</li>
									<li>Traceability: Recommended each test case should trace to only one specification; a specification could be traced by more than one test case.</li>
									<li>Test case structure: Precondition and Steps; action to perform and re-action of the system.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h3><strong>Cause and effect</strong></h3>
								<p>To design a test cases are necessary to bear in mind relate Causes <strong>inputs</strong> to Effects <strong>outputs</strong>. A “Cause” stands for a separate input condition that fetches about an internal change in the 
								system. An “Effect” represents an output condition, a system transformation or a state resulting from a combination of causes. </br></br>
								For example: When the power button is pressed <strong>cause</strong>, the light comes on <strong>effect</strong>.	</p>
								
								<h3><strong>Positive and Negative test case</strong></h3>
								<p>There are test cases aimed at checking the correct operation of the claimed functionality using the correct input format specified in 
								the software documentation.<br>
								There are test cases that check your anticipated every possible situation that should lead to an error message. Also, this type of test cases 
								includes a verification that can lead to unexpected situations, ie those that are not described in the documentation.<br>
								The combination of the two characteristics provide a complete coverage of the every possible situations.</p>
								
								<h3><strong>Test Case Attributes</strong></h3>
								
								<h3>Precondition</h3>
								<p>Details the environment conditions and the state that the test case must satisfy before the test steps execution starts.
								General rules:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Mandatory element</li>
									<li>Presents clearly the data needed to cover the beginning of the test target, including all the required steps to prepare the environment and meet the objective of the test</li>
								</ul>
								<table class="table table-responsive table-striped">
									<thead>
										<tr>
											<th style="color:green;">Correct  Precondition</th>
											<th style="color:red;" >Incorrect Precondition</th>
										</tr>
									</thead>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td><b>Precondition:</b> Make sure that there is a patient with the following characteristics:</br>
												Weigh = 80kg </br>
												Dose = 0.1 ml
											</td>
											<td><b>Precondition:</b> Make sure that you have the correct inputs to execute this test</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td><b>Precondition:</b> Make sure that the read process in the ‘Gestión de Medicamentos’ section is activated.</td>
											<td><b>Precondition:</b> Make sure that the process is activated.</td>
										</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>
																
								
								<h3>Step description</h3>
								<p>Steps: Actions to execute with the goal to obtain a determinate result.
								General rules:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>A Test case could contain unlimited number of test steps. It is advisable to limit the number of the steps in order to facilitate its comprehension and to simplify the executions</li>
									<li>A Test case identifies as unique each test step</li>
									<li>Each step describes an action and the expected result after the action has been performed</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h3>Test Situations</h3>
								<p>Test situation is an isolated condition under which the test object displays a specific behaviour that needs to be tested.
								Situations to be considered for different scenarios:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Input data and response to these entries</li>
									<li>Process and error management</li>
									<li>Reports</li>
									<li>Functional flows</li>
								</ul>
